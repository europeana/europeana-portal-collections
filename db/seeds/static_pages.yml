  :title: Searching Europeana
  :body: |-
    <p>Welcome to Europeana. This page describes some of the things that you can do while you are here. Learn more about:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Searching Europeana</strong>: Search tips, refined search, phrase search, exclude words, auto-completion, filter results, share your search.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploring Europeana</strong>: exhibitions, new content.</li>
        <li><strong>Results in Europeana</strong>: Seeing further details, rights and licence information, translating details, searching on external services, related searches on Europeana, viewing item on provider's site, embedding, and citing.</li>
        <li><strong>Using My Europeana</strong>: Saving searches, saving items, and adding tags.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>General Search</h2>

    <p>Searching the millions of items in Europeana is simple. Just enter your search term and hit <strong>Search</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Specific search</h2>

    <p>You can narrow your search with the arrow to the right of <b>Search All fields</b> and selecting a category: <strong>Titles, Creators, Subjects, Dates/Periods, Places</strong>. Then enter your search term and hit <strong>Search</strong>.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, just ask yourself who, what, where or when you are interested in and type these words into Europeana's search box followed by a colon (:). Then enter your search term and hit <strong>Search</strong>.</p>

    <p>For specific searches, you could:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the <strong>Creator</strong> filter or enter <strong>who:</strong> followed by a name of, for example, an actor, author or architect. Your results will display only items for which the name you entered is listed as the creator. For example, searching for <a href="search.html?query=who%3A+Vincent+van+Gogh">who: Vincent van Gogh</a> will narrow your results to van Gogh's works, excluding photographs of the artist or documentaries about him and his work.</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Subject</strong> or <strong>Title</strong> filter or enter <strong>what:</strong> followed by a type of item, a subject you are interested in or words from the title of the item you are looking for. Your search results will display only items of the requested type or subject or items whose title includes your search term. For example, searching for <a href="search.html?query=what%3A+maps">what: maps</a> will narrow your results to maps, or <a href="search.html?query=what%3A+art+nouveau">what: Art Nouveau</a> will display artworks, buildings and monuments done in the Art Nouveau style.</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Place</strong> filter or enter <strong>where:</strong> followed by a name of a town, city or country within Europe or around the world. Your search results will display only items which were created in, published in or depict the place you are searching for. For example, searching for <a href="search.html?query=where%3A+milan">where: Milan</a> will help you differentiate your search when you are looking only for objects created or held in Milan, excluding items on writer Milan Kundera from your search results.</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Date</strong> filter or enter <strong>when:</strong> followed by a date (e.g. 1945) or a period (e.g. Roman or Medieval). Your search results will display only items for which the date is listed in the item's date field. For example, searching for <a href="search.html?query=when%3A+1984">when: 1984</a> will help you differentiate your search when you are looking only for items dated 1984, excluding items that have 1984 in their title or description, like George Orwell's novel.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>These search functions also have support for different spellings and languages. For example, when you search for <a href="search.html?query=where%3A+milan">where: Milan</a>, the results will also include items with Milano, Mailand or Milanas listed as their geographic coverage.</p>

    <h2>Phrase search</h2>

    <p><b>Phrase search</b> is also possible. Just put <b>quotation marks</b> (e.g. &ldquo;art nouveau&rdquo;) around the phrase you want to find, or type <strong>AND</strong> between the keywords (e.g. art <b>AND</b> nouveau).</p>

    <p><b>Exclude words</b> by typing <strong>NOT</strong> in capital letters, followed by the word you want to omit (e.g. Auguste <b>NOT</b> Renoir)</p>

    <p>Another helpful search feature is <b>Auto completion</b>. Start typing a search term. Europeana will suggest words that may match what you are thinking of. Just select the term you want and hit <strong>Search</strong></p>

    <h2>Refine your search</h2>

     <p>Once you have done an initial search, results can be narrowed down with the <strong>Refine your search</strong> functions. These are in the grey pane on the search results screen. You can add more keywords to your search, thereby narrowing the search results. Just type your keyword into the <strong>Add more keywords</strong> field and hit <strong>+ Add</strong>. The keyword is displayed at the top of the pane, under <b>Matches for.</b></p>

    <p>To remove a keyword, hit the X icon next to the relevant keyword in the <strong>Matches for</strong> list.</p>

    <p>You can also <b>filter your search results:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>By media type</strong> - will display only objects of a selected media type (images, text, video, sound or 3D). </li>
        <li><strong>By language</strong> - will display only objects with descriptions in selected languages, i.e. the language of the institution that provided the object to Europeana.</li>
        <li><strong>By date</strong> - will display only objects with selected dates.</li>
        <li><strong>By country</strong> - will display only objects from selected countries, i.e. the country of the institution that provided the object to Europeana.</li>
        <li><strong>By copyright</strong> – will display objects labelled with the selected copyright label(s). This copyright label indicates how you may reuse the digital object, including the preview.</li>
        <li><strong>By provider</strong> - will display only objects from selected institutions</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Select the filter name, e.g. 'By language' to expand it. Then just use the check boxes for the categories you wish the search results to include. The results will refresh automatically. The filter will be added to the <strong>Matches for</strong> list at the top of the pane.</p>

    <p>To remove a filter, hit the X icon next to the item in the <strong>Matches for</strong> list, or de-select the check box next to the filter category.</p>

    <p>You can also select to <strong>Include content contributed by users</strong>. This means items that have not come from a cultural institution but from an individual user, for example, items contributed to the Europeana 1914-1918 project.</p>

    <p>Share your search with friends by choosing <b>Share</b>. A full list of social media sharing options is presented. Just select one you want. This also includes print and email options.</p>

  :title: About the Music Channel
  :body: <p>Imagine looking at original handwritten manuscripts of a piece of music
    while listening to different interpretations of it, and reading a biography of
    the composer. On the Europeana Music Channel, you can.</p><p><a href="http://www.europeanasounds.eu/">Our
    partners</a>, all experts in music, from across Europe have carefully curated
    this collection of music recordings, sheet music, images of musical instruments,
    books about music and other music-related content. </p><p>We’ve made this early
    test version of the Music Channel available to you, our users, so you can help
    us shape it as we develop it further. So when you visit the site you will at times
    be asked to answer questions or surveys that appear on screen. We would really
    appreciate if you could take the time to answer those questions and surveys!</p><p>Also,
    in the interest of transparency and privacy, you should know that we log user
    statistics and user behaviour in Google Analytics and a service called Hotjar.
    We do that because it shows us where we’ve gone wrong in our designs and so helps
    us to improve the Music Channel. All logs are kept private and anonymised and
    will only be used to improve our service.</p><p>We encourage you to search the
    collection, play music, view the sheet music or read around it. When copyright
    allows, you can download the things you love most. And visit our virtual exhibitions
    to discover music in ways you’ve never done before!</p>

    material comes from all over Europe and the scope of the collections is really
    quite astonishing. Our aim is help you find your way round so you discover treasures
    of your own.</p><p>Over the last few years, we’ve been expanding our collections
    and learning more and more about them, and what you want to do with them. Now
    it’s time to change a few things and make some improvements to our service!</p><p>We’re
    trying out a new version of Europeana Collections. We are working hard to improve
    your experience here and make it as easy as possible for you to find the information
    you are looking for. So we’ll probably ask you to help us by answering some questions.

<p><strong>Give credit where credit is due.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give attribution to the data provider and all contributing data aggregators, including Europeana. Aggregators perform a crucial task in collecting, storing and harmonising data so that it is more widely accessible and interoperable.</li>
<li>Make sure that others are aware of the rights status of the Europeana metadata and are aware of these guidelines. One way you can do this is to keep links to the CC0 Public Domain Dedication intact.</li>
<li>If, for technical or other reasons, you cannot include all the appropriate source links and rights information alongside the metadata that you have used,  you should consider including them separately, for example in a separate document that is distributed with the metadata or dataset.</li>
<li>If, for technical or other reasons, you cannot include all the appropriate source links and rights information alongside the metadata that you have used,  you may consider linking only to the specific metadata source on Europeana, where all available sources and rights information can be found, including machine-readable formats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Metadata is dynamic; consider using the metadata via the Europeana APIs or by linking.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When working with metadata obtained via Europeana,please be aware that it is not static but subject to change. Europeana continuously updates its metadata to correct mistakes and include new and additional information. Therefore, the best way touse metadata published by Europeana is via the Europeana API or by linking to the specific data. If, for technical or other reasons, you cannot do this,then provide a link back to the source of the data on Europeana or implement an update mechanism.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mention your modifications of the metadata and make your modified metadata available under the same terms.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Please do not use the metadata in a way that suggests you have any official status or that the data provider, aggregator or Europeana endorses you or your use of the metadata, unless you have prior permission to do so.</li>
<li>Please do not mislead others or misrepresent the metadata or its sources.</li>
<li>Please make the metadata and any improvements thereto freely available under the same terms as Europeana, i.e., without claiming any legal right to, or imposing any legally binding conditions on access to the metadata or your improvements.</li>

<p><strong>Please note that you use the metadata at your own risk.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Europeana offers the metadata as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning any metadata published by Europeana.</li>

  :title: Public Domain Usage Guidelines
  :body: "<p><strong>Give credit where credit is due.</strong> When you use a public domain 
work please credit the author or creator. Please also credit the 
institution (such as the archive, museum or library) that provided the 
work, as the more you credit the institution the greater the 
encouragement to put more public domain works online.</p>
<p><strong>Protect the reputation of creators and providers.</strong> When you use
 or modify a public domain work you should not attribute the changes to 
the creator or the provider of the work. The name or logo of the creator
 or provider should not be used to endorse the modified work or any use 
of it without their consent.</p>
<p><strong>Show respect for the original work.</strong> Please do not use the work
 in any way that is unlawful and misleading. When you modify and 
redistribute a public domain work, any changes made to the original 
should be clearly indicated. You should label the work to show you have 
changed it, so that other users know who made the changes.</p>
<p><strong>Show respect for the creator.</strong> If the creator, or provider on 
behalf of the creator, has asked that a public domain work should not be
 changed or that it should be used in certain contexts only, then please
 respect their wishes.</p>
<p><strong>Share knowledge.</strong> If you use a public domain work to generate 
new work or if you have additional information about it (such where it 
came from, its author, content or other possible rights holders), please
 share your knowledge. That may include tagging, annotating or 
commenting on a public domain work that is published online and sending 
back this information to the institution that holds the original object.</p>
<p><strong>Be culturally aware.</strong> If the work includes culturally sensitive
 elements you should not change or use these in ways that might be 
derogatory to other cultures or communities.</p>
<p><strong>Support efforts to enrich the public domain.</strong> Users of public 
domain works are asked to support the efforts of cultural and scientific
 heritage organisations to care for, preserve, digitise and make public 
domain works available. This support should include monetary

<ol>
<p style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"><strong>Applicability of these terms of use</strong></p>

<li>In addition thereto, the User must, before using the Europeana API, accept these terms of use where this option is made available in the sign-up form for the API.</li>
<p style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"><strong>Use of the API-key</strong></p>
<li>API-keys are confidential and are for use by the User only and may not be shared with third parties unless with express agreement from Europeana.</li>
<li>An API-key applies to a single Implementation. The User needs to create a separate API-key for every new Implementation. </li>
<li>Europeana reserves the right to terminate individual Europeana API-keys that are used to display data obtained via the Europeana API in contexts that are illegal, pornographic, defamatory or can be detrimental to the reputation of Europeana in any other way.</li>
<p style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"><strong>Provision of the Europeana API</strong></p>
<li>Europeana will provide the User with public technical documentation of the Europeana API, but will not provide technical support for Users unless explicitly agreed otherwise.</li>
<li>Europeana will log all uses of the Europeana API by the User for the purpose of monitoring service load and for the purpose of improving the Europeana API.</li>
<li>Europeana may limit the number of transactions the User may send or receive through the Europeana API. Such a limit may be set by Europeana at any time to ensure even performance of the Europeana API to all Users.</li>
<li>Europeana will continually upgrade the Europeana API by adding new features.

<p style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"><strong>Use of Metadata, Previews and Content</strong></p>
<li>All Metadata that are exposed through the Europeana API are published under the terms of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"cc:useGuidelines\" resource=\"http://www.europeana.eu/rights/metadata-usage-guidelines/\">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</a> and can be freely re-used for any purpose.</li>
<li>The Europeana API also provides URLs pointing to Previews hosted on Europeana.eu (edm:preview) and to Content hosted by Europeana's data providers (europeana:object, enclosure, edm:object and edm:isShownBy). The files identified by these URLs do not fall under the scope of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"cc:useGuidelines\" resource=\"http://www.europeana.eu/rights/metadata-usage-guidelines/\">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</a> and may only be used in accordance with the rights statements contained in the europeana:rights/edm:rights record associated with the digital object (note that there are some uses such as embedding or linking that do not require permission in most jurisdictions). If there is no rights statement contained in the europeana:rights/edm:rights field or if the europeana:rights/edm:rights field is missing, the User shall assume that these Previews and Content may only be used in accordance with the applicable copyright laws, unless the website of the data provider gives different permissions relating to the Preview and/or Content.</li>
<li>The User is encouraged to follow the <a href=\"metadata-usage-guidelines.html\">Europeana Usage Guidelines for Metadata</a> and to provide attribution to the data sources including, where possible, links to the Content on the original data providers' websites.</li>
<li>Users of the API are requested to use the &lsquo;Powered by Europeana&rsquo; logo in close proximity to the Metadata whenever such Metadata are displayed to indicate that they are obtained from the Europeana API. The &lsquo;Powered by Europeana&rsquo; logo as well as instructions for using the logo can be found <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/about/comms-tools/logos\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to download the powered by Europeana logo\">here</a>.</li>
<p style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"><strong>Notice and Takedown</strong></p>
<li>Europeana is not the owner of the copyrights to the Metadata, the Previews or the Content. This information has been provided to Europeana by a large number of contributing institutions and organizations. These data providers have ensured Europeana that the owners of these rights have agreed to the publication of their works under the applicable conditions as referred to above. However, Europeana cannot guarantee that this is always correct.</li>
<li>In the event that Europeana is under the impression that it is publishing Metadata or Previews to which it is not entitled, it will remove these Metadata or Previews from the Europeana API. The User must cease use of such Metadata and Previews upon first request thereto from Europeana.</li>
<p style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"><strong>Liability Disclaimer</strong></p>
<li>The Europeana Foundation does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of the Metadata, Previews or Content.</li>
<li>Except to the extent required by applicable law, in no event will Europeana be liable on any legal theory for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out the use of Metadata, Previews or Content. In particular, it will not be liable for the following:</li>
<ul style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">
<li>accuracy, completeness, etc. of the Metadata, Previews or Content;</li>
<li>any infringement of privacy, publicity, copyrights or other rights, including infringement of copyrights to Metadata, Previews or Content made available through the Europeana API under conditions that were not approved by the right holder; </li>
<li>any use by third parties that goes beyond the rights expressed in these terms of use.</li>
</ul>
<p style=\"margin-top: 10px;\"><strong>These terms of use</strong></p>
<li>Europeana reserves the right to amend these terms of use. The User will be bound to the amended terms of use. Every subsequent reference to &lsquo;these terms of use&rsquo; is considered to refer to the amended terms of use, once the User has been informed of the amendments and has reasonably been in the position to adjust use that began before the amendment of the terms of use. A User is considered to have been informed of amendments to these terms of use once Europeana has informed the User of the amendments via the  email address provided by the User upon registration for an API-key, or the email address provided by the User to replace this email address.</li>
<li>The rights provided to the User in these terms of use will expire automatically upon any breach by the User of the terms included herein.</li>
<li>These terms of use are governed by the laws of The Netherlands.</li>

<h2 class=\"article\" class=\"article\">Article <dt>&nbsp;</dt> Applicability</h2>
<dd class=\"first\">These Terms for User Contributions apply to Users when they are using the Service. They do not apply to Visitors. The Europeana Terms of Use that can be found at <a href=\"terms-of-use.html\" title=\"The Europeana Terms of use page\">http://www.europeana.eu/rights/terms-of-use/</a> apply to Visitors, including Users in their capacity as Visitors.</dd>
<dd>Europeana is entitled at all times to amend or supplement these Terms of Use. In such an event, the amended Terms for User Contributions will be sent to the User's Email Address. If the User continues using the Service after the amended or supplemented Terms for User Contributions have been sent to the Email Address, he/she thereby irrevocably accepts such conditions. If the User does not agree to the amended or supplemented Terms of Use, he/she must refrain from using the Service, and he/she must close his/her Account. The applicable Terms for User Contributions are available on the Website at all times.</dd>
<h2 class=\"article\">Article <dt>&nbsp;</dt> Registration for the Service</h2>
<dd class=\"first\">Before Content or Metadata can be contributed to the Website, the User must create an Account in the manner described on the Website. During registration, the User must also enter a Username and a Password, which will provide access to the Account.</dd>
<dd>It is the responsibility of the User to keep the Username/Password combination confidential. The User is therefore responsible for all use that is made of the Service through the Username and the Password. Europeana may assume that the User is in fact the person who is seeking access with the Username and the Password that belong to him/her.  As soon as the User is aware or as soon as he/she may have reason to suspect that a Username and/or Password has become known to unauthorised persons, the User must notify Europeana immediately. This does not affect his/her own obligation to take effective measures immediately, such as changing the Password.</dd>
<dd>If the User is younger than 16 years of age, he/she is only allowed to use the Service if he/she has the consent of his/her legal representative(s). By accepting these Terms of Use, the User guarantees that he/she is in fact 16 years of age or older, or that he/she has obtained the consent of his/her legal representative(s) to create an Account and to use the Service.</dd>
<dd>Europeana reserves the right to alter the login procedure, the Password and/or the Username, if it considers this necessary in any way, for instance if this is in the interests of the operation of the Service. In that event, the User will be notified of this by email using the Email Address. </dd>
<h2 class=\"article\">Article <dt>&nbsp;</dt> The Service</h2>
<dd class=\"first\">The User accepts that the Service only contains the functionality and other features found by him/her when using the Service. The Service is, therefore, delivered 'as is'. Europeana expressly excludes explicit and tacit guarantees, undertakings and warranties of any nature whatsoever, including but not limited to guarantees, promises and warranties with respect to the quality, safety, availability, lawfulness, integrity and correctness of the Service.</dd>
<dd>Europeana does not guarantee that the Website and/or the Service will at all times be accessible without interruptions or failures. Failures in the Website and/or the Service may occur as a result of, amongst other things, failures in internet or telephone connections or because of viruses or faults/defects. Europeana is in no way responsible or liable for compensating the User for any damage or loss arising from or as a result of the Website and/or the Service being unavailable or temporarily unavailable, or in case of a breakdown of the Website and/or the Service.</dd>
<dd>Europeana is entitled, without any prior notice being required and without being liable to compensate the User, to close down or to temporarily close down the Website and/or the Service and/or to limit the use of it if it considers this necessary, for instance in connection with any reasonably necessary maintenance of the Website and/or the Service.</dd>
<dd>Europeana is entitled, without any prior announcement being required, to make procedural and technical changes and/or improvements to the Website and/or the Service.</dd>
<h2 class=\"article\">Article <dt>&nbsp;</dt> Use of Content by Europeana</h2>
<dd class=\"first\">All Content that is protected by Intellectual Property Rights contributed by the User to the Website will be made available by Europeana to Third Parties under the terms of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence</a>. Content that is in the Public Domain will be marked with the Public Domain Mark. </dd>
<dd>If the User is the proprietor of the Intellectual Property Rights of the Content contributed by him/her; he/she hereby authorises Europeana to perform Article 5.1 with respect to that Content. If the User is not the proprietor of the Intellectual Property Rights of the Content contributed by him/her, he/she guarantees that either:<ul>
<li>He/she is authorised by the proprietor of the Intellectual Property Rights of this Content to authorise Europeana to perform Article 5.1 with respect to that Content; or </li>
<li>The Content is Public Domain.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>If required and in addition to the rights granted under Article 5.2 in conjunction with Article 5.1, the User grants Europeana a free, unencumbered, worldwide, non-exclusive licence for the use, reproduction, distribution and communication of the Content, and for making the Content publicly available, to the extent that this is necessary for the Service to be provided. </dd>
<dd>The licence referred to in Article 5.3 ends once the User and/or Europeana remove(s) the relevant Content from the Website, or once the Account is removed by the User and/or Europeana, except for the situation where and in as far as Content has become part of a curated collection of Content on the Website which has been created by the Europeana Foundation or by Users of the Website.  </dd>
<dd>Although the Website will indicate that use by Third Parties of the Content contributed by the User is governed by the Terms of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence</a>, the User acknowledges and accepts that Europeana is not responsible and/or liable for compliance by Visitors with the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence</a>.</dd>

<dd>If the User is the proprietor of the Intellectual Property Rights of the Metadata contributed by him/her; he/she hereby authorises Europeana to perform Article 6.1 with respect to that Metadata. If the User is not the proprietor of the Intellectual Property Rights of the Metadata contributed by him/her, he/she guarantees that either: <ul>
<li>He/she is authorised by the proprietor of the Intellectual Property Rights of this Metadata to authorise Europeana to perform Article 6.1 with respect to the Metadata; or </li>
<li>The Metadata are Public Domain.</li></ul></dd>
<h2 class=\"article\">Article <dt>&nbsp;</dt> Unlawful Use of the Service</h2>
<dd class=\"first\">The User is aware of and accepts that Europeana has no knowledge of Content and Metadata that is made available through the Service.

<dd>The User guarantees that he/she will not distribute through the Website any Content or Metadata:<ul style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha;\">

<li>that contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms, bots or other software that may damage automated work or data, render it unusable or inaccessible, delete or appropriate it, or that is intended to circumvent technical protection measures of the Website and/or Europeana's computer systems;</li>
<li>that is in violation of any applicable legislation and regulations; </li>
<li>that is in violation of any of the other provisions of these Terms of Use.  </li></ul></dd>
<dd>The User indemnifies Europeana against Third-Party claims that are based on the statement that Content or Metadata placed by the User with the help of the Service in some way infringes the rights of Third Parties and/or is unlawful in any other way.</dd>
<dd>Without being required to give notice or without being liable for compensation, and without prejudice to Europeana's right to take further legal action, Europeana reserves the right to remove Content or Metadata or to close an Account if it considers there are grounds for doing so, in particular in, but not limited to, cases in which, in Europeana's opinion, the User breaches the provisions of this Article 7 or any other provision of these Terms of Use.</dd>   
<dd>If the User is of the opinion that Content or Metadata distributed with the help of the Service is unlawful, he/she can Report this. Such a Report to Europeana can be made by emailing <a href=\"m&#97;i&#108;&#116;o&#58;n%6F&#116;i&#99;%65%40e&#117;%&#55;&#50;opea%6E%61&#46;eu?subject=Reporting%20an%20unlawful%20use%20of%20the%20service\" class=\"email\" title=\"Mail Europeana to report an unlawful use of the service\">no&#116;&#105;ce&#64;europeana&#46;eu</a></dd>
<h2 class=\"article\">Article <dt>&nbsp;</dt> Privacy</h2>
<dd class=\"first\">In connection with the Service, the User will provide Europeana with personal data as defined in the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act (Wet beschermingpersoonsgegevens - Wbp). Europeana will only process and use these personal data where necessary in connection with the Service, and it will not supply these personal data to Third Parties in any manner whatsoever, unless it is legally obliged to do so.</dd>
<dd>The User understands and acknowledges that the Username entered by him/her upon registration will be displayed in connection with the Content and/or Metadata and that any personal data in the Username will be disclosed. Users can change their Usernames themselves.</dd>
<h2 class=\"article\">Article <dt>&nbsp;</dt> Liability</h2>
<dd class=\"first\">Europeana assumes no liability for damage or loss as a result of any failure in fulfilment of the provision of the Service, including but not limited to damage or loss arising from or relating to the use of the Website and/or any impossibility of using it, or as a result of any unlawful act or otherwise, unless this exclusion of liability is not allowed under mandatory provisions of law.  </dd>
<dd>Europeana assumes no liability for the substance of the Content and/or Metadata, nor, therefore, for damage or loss to Users or other Third Parties that arises from any unlawful substance of the Content and/or Metadata. </dd>
<dd>The User indemnifies Europeana against all Third-Party claims on any grounds whatsoever that relate to the compensation of damage, loss, costs or interest, in connection with or arising from his/her use of the Service and/or any breach of these Terms for User Contributions and/or any other rights of Third Parties.</dd>
<dd>This restriction of liability does not, however, intend to exclude Europeana's liability for intent and/or wilful recklessness by Europeana ('own actions') itself and/or its executive managers.</dd>
<dd>The only action the User may take if he/she is of the opinion that he/she has sustained any damage or loss is to cease using the Service and close his/her Account. </dd>
<h2 class=\"article\">Article <dt>&nbsp;</dt> Duration and Termination</h2>
<dd class=\"first\">The User is entitled to cease using the Service and close his/her Account at any time.</dd>
<dd>Europeana is at all times entitled to terminate and/or suspend the availability of the Service to the User if it considers there are grounds for doing so, without creating any liability on its part towards the User.</dd>
<h2 class=\"article\">Article <dt>&nbsp;</dt> Miscellaneous, Applicable Law and Competent Court</h2>
<dd class=\"first\">These Terms for User Contributions and the use of the Service are governed by the laws of The Netherlands.</dd>
<dd>Where national or international rules of law do not contain mandatory provisions to the contrary, all disputes between the User and Europeana will, at the discretion of the party serving a summons or the party making an application, be brought before the competent court in the district of his/her place of residence or place of business, or before another court that is competent pursuant to national or international rules of law.</dd>
<dd>Should any provision of these Terms for User Contributions be or become invalid, the User and Europeana will remain bound to the remaining provisions.  Europeana will replace the invalid provision by a valid provision, in accordance with the object and purport of these Terms of Use, in such a way that the new provision differs as little as possible from the invalid provisions.</dd>

  :title: Public Domain Charter
  :body: "<p><strong>Europeana, Europe's digital library, museum and archive, belongs to the public and must represent the public interest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Public Domain is the material from which society derives knowledge and fashions new cultural works.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Having a healthy and thriving Public Domain is essential to the social and economic well-being of society.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Digitisation of Public Domain content does not create new rights over it: works that are in the Public Domain in analogue form continue to be in the Public Domain once they have been digitised.</strong></p>
<h2>Principles for a healthy Public Domain</h2>
<p>Museums, libraries and archives of all kinds are holders of our cultural and scientific heritage. These memory organisations are the guardians of society's shared knowledge. They play an essential part in maintaining the Public Domain on behalf of citizens and must uphold a number of general principles. These principles are essential to preserve a meaningful understanding of the Public Domain and to ensure that it continues to function in the technological environment of the networked information society. These principles are not intended to prevent organisations from commercial exploitation of Public Domain works in their collections. Instead they provide a set of minimum standards that ensures that the Public Domain functions in the digital environment.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Copyright protection is temporary.</strong> Copyright gives creators a time-limited monopoly regarding the control of their works. Once this period has expired, these works automatically fall into the Public Domain. The mass of knowledge over recorded time is in the Public Domain; copyright offers an appropriate and time-limited exception to this status.</li>
<li><strong>What is in the Public Domain needs to remain in the Public Domain.</strong> Exclusive control over Public Domain works cannot be re-established by claiming exclusive rights in technical reproductions of the works, or by using technical and or contractual measures to limit access to technical reproductions of such works. Works that are in the Public Domain in analogue form continue to be in the Public Domain once they have been digitised.</li>
<li><strong>The lawful user of a digital copy of a Public Domain work should be free to (re-) use, copy and modify the work.</strong> Public Domain status of a work guarantees the right to re-use, modify and make reproductions and this must not be limited through technical and or contractual measures. When a work has entered the Public Domain there is no longer a legal basis to impose restrictions on the use of that work.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Guidelines for preserving the function of the Public Domain</h2>
<p>There are a number of significant developments that threaten the function of the Public Domain. Over the last decades we have witnessed an expansion of the scope of copyright both in terms of time and protected subject matter. This has been detrimental to the Public Domain and the ability of citizens and memory organisations to interact with important parts of our shared culture and knowledge. The following Guidelines are issued to counter this trend.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Any change to the scope of copyright protection needs to take into account the effects on the Public Domain.</strong> Changes to the scope of copyright must not be retroactive. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century copyright has been extended to accommodate the interests of rights holders at the expense of the Public Domain. As a result a large portion of our shared culture and knowledge is locked away behind copyright and technical restrictions, and we must ensure that this situation will not be worsened in the future.</li>
<li><strong>No other intellectual property right must be used to reconstitute exclusivity over Public Domain material.</strong> The Public Domain is an integral element of the internal balance of the copyright system. This internal balance must not be manipulated by attempts to reconstitute or obtain exclusive control via regulations that are external to copyright. No technological protection measures backed-up by statute should limit the practical value of works in the Public Domain. Industrial property rights, such as trademarks, should not be used to restrict the re-use and copying of Public Domain works.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Public Domain is a shared resource that underpins contemporary society. As knowledge and information are digitised, legal contracts are often being used that inhibit free access to the digitised Public Domain. This runs counter to the founding objective of Europeana. Our essential aim is to make Europe's Public Domain cultural and scientific heritage freely accessible to citizens in digital form to encourage the development of knowledge and stimulate creative enterprise and innovation. This is the position of the European Commission, who fund Europeana, and the Europeana Foundation, who run the service.</p>
<p>The Europeana Foundation is made up of international associations that represent museums, archives, audiovisual collections and libraries: the memory organisations which provide content to Europeana. It is in the Foundation's interest to be clear on the use and meaning of the Public Domain. Europeana belongs to the public and must represent the public interest.</p>
<p>This Charter is a policy statement, not a contract. It does not bind Europeana's content providers to any position. The Europeana Foundation is issuing the Charter in order to influence the debate among the Europe's memory organisations, policy makers and funders about the terms under which Public Domain digital content is made available.</p>
<p>In its access and re-use terms Europeana follows the policies of its content providers. Each of them is legally responsible for deciding the terms on which they make content available, and for determining and clearing any rights in their content. Consequently, there are a wide range of practices among institutions providing Public Domain content to Europeana.</p>
<p>The Public Domain Charter will help to promote greater consistency for the benefit of our users. Users have complained of the range of different practices and especially that some content providers charge for downloading and even for accessing digitised items which are in the Public Domain in their analogue form. They perceive this as a barrier to citizens wishing legitimate access to their Public Domain heritage.</p>
<h2>What is the Public Domain?</h2>
<p>The Public Domain comprises all the knowledge and information &ndash; including books, pictures and audiovisual works &ndash; which does not have copyright protection and can be used without restriction, subject in some European countries to the author's perpetual moral rights. The Public Domain provides a historically developed balance to the rights of creators protected by copyright and it is essential to the cultural memory and knowledge base of our societies. The Public Domain covers two categories of material:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Works on which copyright protection has expired.</strong> Copyright in a work in most of Europe lasts for 70 years after the death of its longest living creator. If copyright is held by a corporation, then it lasts for 70 years after publication. Once this temporary protection has come to its end, all legal restrictions cease to exist. It means that almost everything published, painted, photographed or released anywhere in the world before the 20<sup>th</sup> century is out of copyright and in the Public Domain.</li>
<li><strong>The essential commons of information that is not covered by copyright.</strong> Works are not protected by copyright if they are not original. Ideas and facts are not covered by copyright, but the expression of them is. Laws and judicial and administrative decisions are excluded from this protection. This essential commons is regarded as too important for the functioning our societies to be burdened with legal restrictions of any nature even for a limited period.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that next to the Public Domain as described above there are a number of other limitations and exceptions that reduce legal restrictions and ensure sufficient access to our shared knowledge and culture. These exceptions ensure that the copyright granted to creators does not interfere with certain specific requirements of society. They ensure access, enable the functioning of essential social institutions and provide for the social participation of individuals with special needs.</p>
<h2>Why is the Public Domain important?</h2>
<p>The Public Domain is the raw material from which we make new knowledge and create new cultural works. Having a healthy and thriving Public Domain is essential to the social and economic well-being of our societies.</p>
<p>Much of the world's knowledge &ndash; Diderot's Encyclop&eacute;die, the paintings of Leonardo, Newton's Laws of Motion &ndash; is in the Public Domain. Society constantly re-uses, reinterprets and reproduces material in the Public Domain and by doing so develops new ideas and creates new work. New theories, inventions, cultural works and the like are indebted to the knowledge and creativity of previous centuries.</p>
<h2>The Public Domain in the digital age</h2>
<p>The internet gives access to the digitised portion of that knowledge and creativity on a scale previously impossible. It is the driver for massive digitisation efforts that will fundamentally change the role of cultural and scientific heritage institutions. The digitisation of analogue collections creates new opportunities for sharing and creative re-use, empowering people to explore and respond to our shared heritage in new ways that our legislation has yet to catch up with. It has also brought copyright to the centre of attention for holders of our cultural and scientific heritage. Our memory organisations have for generations had the public duty of holding the heritage in trust for the citizenry and of making it accessible to all. Both of these functions are usually conducted at the citizens' &ndash; i.e. the tax payers' &ndash; expense.</p>
<p>Entrusted with the preservation of our shared knowledge and culture, not-for-profit memory organisations should take upon themselves a special role in the effective labelling and preserving of Public Domain works. As part of this role they need to ensure that works in the Public Domain are accessible to all of society, by making them available as widely as possible. It is important for memory organisations to recognise that as the guardians of our shared culture and knowledge they play a central role in enabling the creativity of citizens and providing the raw materials for contemporary culture, science, innovation and economic growth.</p>
<p>At the same time the transformation from guardians of analogue collections to providers of digital services places enormous challenges on these organisations. Creating and maintaining digital collections is expensive; the cultural heritage sector may lack resources for this new responsibility. Government sponsors may encourage or require organisations to generate income by way of licensing content to a wide variety of commercial users.</p>
<p>Public-Private Partnerships have become one option for funding large scale digitisation efforts. Commercial content aggregators pay for the digitisation in exchange for privileged access to the digitised collections. These activities are seen as a reason for attempting to exercise as much control as possible over digital reproductions of Public Domain works. Organisations are claiming exclusive rights in digitised versions of Public Domain works and are entering into exclusive relationships with commercial partners that hinder free access.</p>
<p>When this exclusivity locks down digital content and inhibits access and re-use by teachers, innovators and citizens, memory organisations may be compromising their core mission and undermining their relationship with their users. Works that are in the Public Domain in analogue form must remain freely available in digital form and digitisation of such works must lead to increased access by the public instead of new restrictions. To remain relevant in the digital age, cultural and scientific heritage organisations must strive to increase access to our shared knowledge and culture by being the primary points of access to the works that they have in their collections. Value-added services can be developed around content without the need to claim exclusive rights over works that have been in the Public Domain in analogue form.</p>
<p>Ultimately, at a political and policy-making level, it is in the interests of society that Public Domain knowledge and information be digitised. Once digitised, it should be freely available to creative enterprise, <abbr title=\"Research and Development\">R&amp;D</abbr> innovators and technical entrepreneurs to use as the basis for generating ideas and applications yet to be envisaged.</p>
<p>The aim of this Charter is to give a clear signal to content providers, policy makers and the public that Europeana and the Europeana Foundation believe in and wish to strengthen the concept of the Public Domain in the digitised world. In order to do so we need a robust and up-to-date understanding of the nature of this essential resource.</p>
